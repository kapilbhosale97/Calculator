## 🧮 Calculator Project

📌 Project Overview
This is a simple and user-friendly Calculator Application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
The project is built using clean and structured code to help beginners understand how a calculator works programmatically.

✅ Features
➕ Addition of numbers
➖ Subtraction of numbers
✖ Multiplication of numbers
➗ Division of numbers
❌ Error handling for division by zero
🧼 Clear and reset function
👨‍💻 Easy to use interface / console-based (depending on your implementation)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git
cd calculator

Run the program
python calculator.py

(Change command based on your programming language)

## ✨ Example Output

Enter first number: 10  
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *  
Enter second number: 5  
Result = 50

## 🧠 How It Works (Logic)
Take input values from the user
Select the operator
Use conditional statements (if-else / switch-case)
Perform calculation and display output
Handle invalid input or division by zero errors

## 📈 Future Improvements
✅ Add GUI (Graphical User Interface)
✅ Add scientific functions (sin, cos, log, sqrt)
✅ Add history of previous calculations
✅ Add keyboard support
